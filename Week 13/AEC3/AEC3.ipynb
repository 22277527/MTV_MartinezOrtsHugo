    "### a) **Interpretation of Results (1.5 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "A multiple linear regression was performed to model per capita spending on the Royal Lottery in 1830s France as a function of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Literacy**\n",
    "- **Wealth**\n",
    "- **Region** (a categorical variable with multiple levels)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Fit:**\n",
    "   - **R² = 0.338**: The model explains 33.8% of the variance in lottery spending.\n",
    "   - **Adjusted R² = 0.287**: Slightly lower, accounting for the number of predictors.\n",
    "   - **F-statistic = 6.636, p-value = 1.07e-05**: The model is statistically significant overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Predictor Coefficients:**\n",
    "   - **Intercept = 38.65**: Baseline lottery spending for the reference region (likely the omitted category), with 0 wealth and literacy (not directly interpretable).\n",
    "   - **Wealth = 0.4515, p < 0.001**: Statistically significant. Each unit increase in wealth increases lottery spending by ~0.45 units.\n",
    "   - **Literacy = -0.1858, p = 0.63**: Not statistically significant. Literacy does not show a clear linear effect.\n",
    "   - **Region (T.E, T.N, T.S, T.W)**: None of the regional dummy variables are statistically significant (all p > 0.05), suggesting no strong regional differences compared to the reference region.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Diagnostics:**\n",
    "   - **Skew = -0.340**, **Kurtosis = 2.454**: Residuals are fairly close to normal distribution.\n",
    "   - **Durbin-Watson = 1.785**: No strong evidence of autocorrelation.\n",
    "   - **Omnibus p-value = 0.218**: Residuals do not significantly deviate from normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) **Prediction Model Justification (0.5 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This model **could be used for prediction**, but it is **not ideal in its current state**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Adjusted R² is low (0.287)**, meaning much of the variance is unexplained.\n",
    "- **Only Wealth is a statistically significant predictor**.\n",
    "- **No assessment of multicollinearity or interactions** has been performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To Improve the Model:\n",
    "1. **Model selection techniques** (e.g., stepwise regression, AIC/BIC).\n",
    "2. **Feature engineering** (e.g., interaction terms, transformations).\n",
    "3. **Cross-validation or train-test split** to evaluate predictive performance.\n",
    "4. **Try alternative models** (e.g., decision trees, random forests) if prediction accuracy is more important than interpretability.\n"
